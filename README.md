===============================


The game consists of a Player (you) and Bugs.

The Player can (use the arrow keys to) move left, right, up and down. While the
bugs move in varying speeds (from left to right) along the paved block portion
of the scene.

The goal of the game is for the player (you), to cross the paved block portion
to the water without colliding with any of the bugs.  If the player collides
with a bug, the game resets with the player back to the starting point.

Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
